# History of the project
Started 1/31/25 - Ended WIP
## Data Collection Screens
3/2/25 - The front end was stylized to look a little cooler! I also fixed the light sensor... I forgot to ground it

3/1/25 - The Front end now displays how far an object is and if motion is detected (not sure why the Photo resistor is at 1k lux, but I hope I didn't break that along with my ultrasonic ranger). I have plans to make this look better

2/27/25 - C# dotnet to send to a JavaScript Electron App for easier viewing! (I have plans to make it look awesome at a later date)

## Hardware
3/1/25 - It now reads Light levels, temperature, humidity, detects motion, and how far something may be. LED Inidcator lights RED - Photoresistor, YELLOW - DHT11 module, BLUE - ultrasonic module, GREEN - Motion Detector

2/2/25 Here is an image of where the physical component. It reads Light levels, temperature, and humidity. There are LED indicator lights that show if everything is working. The picture makes it hard to see but the RED LED = Photoresistor and the YELLOW LED = DHT11 module. I plan to add more per each module I add to this probe
