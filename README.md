# RugerProbe
This is a probe device named after my dog Ruger. It will read telemetry data and store it with eventual wireless communication

## WIP (This is in the early stages as of 1/31/25) 
I am currently designing and picking the hardware to use/designing the code behind it. I will add pictures to the read-me when available

- Arduino Uno (in the prototype phase, if built may use Arduino Nano)
- temperature and humidity levels (DHT22) 
- light levels (photoresistor [Might switch to TSL2562])
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Measure distance with Ultrasonic Ranging Module (HC-SR04)
